# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is the final solution for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course from the React Nanodegree Program. It's a mobile application that can store collections of flashcards.

Users of the app are able to:

* Create different categories of flashcards called "decks"
* Add flashcards to specific decks
* Take quizzes on created decks

## Start and Launch the project

To get started right away:

- `cd MobileFlashcards`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

## Platforms tested

This React Native App has been tested on an Android device (Android version 7.0)
